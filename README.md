# Projects desc
• Project 2: Implemented a tank, UFOs, and moving backgrounds. The player moves the tank and shoots the randomly
moving UFOs while changing the cannon ball’s speed (being shot by the tank). The background changes after 10
minutes into the game.

• Project 3: Using geometry to calculate the angle of the tank’s pistole and detect the randomly placed UFOs to shoot
them automatically. The tank is static.

• Project 4: Implemented a program that simulates the lighting effect (reflection) on multiple planets that orbit around
the sun
